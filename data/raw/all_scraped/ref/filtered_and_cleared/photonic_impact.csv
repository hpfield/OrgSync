###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Aston research into Optical Coherence Tomography \(OCT\) metrology resulted in new product lines: 

-  With Arden Photonics, Aston designed and fabricated OCT phantoms used to calibrate, test and validate the performance of OCT systems, aiding quality assurance. It remains the only commercially available OCT phantom technology in the world. 

-  With Optimec, Aston developed an OCT instrument that allows contact lens manufacturers to confirm that their products meet the required specification. This has enabled the adoption of new technology within the increasingly sophisticated global eye correction industry. It resulted in a second instrument with increased performance to be used in production lines.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 University of Bristol \(UoB\) research has produced a diverse cluster of companies exploiting quantum photonic technologies, including the world’s most highly funded start\-up quantum computing company, which has raised USD215M and created over 100 jobs. Companies exploiting UoB research are enabling secure telecommunications; reducing diagnostic time and reliance on broad\-spectrum antibiotics in healthcare; and combating climate change by preventing leakage of natural gas from production facilities. The research has led to the founding of a skills and training centre for quantum entrepreneurs from which 31 new businesses have been developed, attracting a combined investment of GBP44.8M and creating 126 new highly skilled jobs. To grow this vibrant technology ecosystem, we have attracted GBP91M for a business incubator which will further enhance Bristol’s position as a world leading centre for the commercialisation of quantum technologies.

The University of Bath,Commercialisation of antiresonant hollow optical fibres with major investment in two SMEs,Technological,[France];[Global],[GLO Photonics];[Lumenisity];[Amplitude];[Trumpf];[DMG Mori Seiki],,,"
 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 A hollow optical fibre has long been a technical goal in order to overcome problems in manufacturing, communication and instrumentation. In an empty core there is no material to damage when using a high power laser, and no material to absorb the light when working at wavelengths far into the ultraviolet or infrared. It has required researchers to find an efficient physical process to trap light in a hollow core. 

 University of Bath research showed that this can be achieved with an antiresonant hollow optical fibre and that an inwardly curving core wall further reduces the optical losses. Antiresonant hollow optical fibres incorporating these designs are the founding technology of GLOphotonics, a University of Bath spin out, and Lumenisity, with a combined workforce of more than \[text removed for publication\] people, sales revenues of EUR\[text removed for publication\] and more than GBP\[text removed for publication\] investment in this REF period.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 
 Biological objects imaged using Airy beamlight sheet fluorescence microscopy. 

Our research on the physics of optical beams has led to the commercialisation of a new form of microscopy known as Airy beam light sheet fluorescence microscopy \(LSFM\). It is a powerful new 3D optical imaging technique that finds principal application in cell biology and neuroscience. The key innovation is the use of a special light beam profile, the Airy beam profile, which results in several advantages over existing microscopes: a 20 fold increase in the field of view whilst achieving deep sample penetration and high resolution, up to 20 times reduction in imaging time, and  lower phototoxicity thus causing less damage to cells. 

 The University’s Airy beam LSFM technology was exclusively licensed to M Squared Lasers Ltd. They spun out a legally and financially separate biophotonics business unit, M Squared Life Ltd, in 2016 specifically to develop and sell a new scientific instrument, the “Aurora” light sheet microscope, based on the Airy beam. The economic impact has arisen through the creation of \[text removed for publication\] jobs \[text removed for publication\], the sale of Aurora systems, which has raised over \[text removed for publication\] in revenue up to March 2020, and the securing of \[text removed for publication\] investment to grow both businesses. 

 End users of Aurora work on understanding diseases and processes in neuroscience and developmental biology in Universities, Research Institutes and National Laboratories and are located worldwide, including the UK, across Europe \(e.g. Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine\), South Africa, and the USA. Compared with competing technologies, Aurora enables end users to image a wider variety of biological samples with less photon damage and do so more rapidly and with unprecedented image quality over a larger volume. These benefits are enabling new imaging approaches not previously possible, particularly for live samples.

 This case study charts the success of a new class of photonic humidity sensors for use in so\-called “extreme environments” such as are experienced by Sydney Water in its day\-to\-day operations. Developed in research at City, University of London, the sensors overcame weaknesses of existing technologies, to supply online, long\-term, continuous humidity data resulting in reduced maintenance, reduced fines and regulation penalties, and greater stability of water supply. Further developments led to its deployment as a solution to problems Sydney Water experienced in 2018 with pumping stations and specifically with structural defects in some aged concrete structures. The project’s deliverables have created a new climate of thinking about the development and exploitation of photonics\-based sensors to tackle a range of problems at Sydney Water, based on the project’s many successes.

 **1. Summary of the impact** 

 
Commercial deep\-sea divers around the world face some of the most dangerous conditions of any profession. Our innovative photonics research into non\-linear frequency conversion and its implementation in the design of compact, stable solid\-state lasers provides safety guidance within deep water diving environments by creating a continuous line of light to indicate the route of the diver’s umbilical. It also helps remotely operated vehicle \(ROV\) pilots minimise the risk of collision or snagging umbilicals, particularly at night or in poor visibility. This research led to the University of St Andrews forming the spin\-out company, PhotoSynergy Ltd, which has developed a range of patented products based on its LIGHTPATH<sup>®</sup> side\-emitting optical fibre illumination system. 

 Having gained recognition within the sector by winning the Subsea UK Innovation for Safety Award in 2014, our systems are influencing the operating procedures and regulations of key industry leaders such as Shell UK Ltd, who now recommend using LIGHTPATH<sup>®</sup> for dive umbilicals as an aid to diver safety. Divers themselves are requesting umbilical lighting. 

 LIGHTPATH<sup>®</sup> is the only dive umbilical lighting system on the market. The end user benefits in safety and efficiency are clear; since August 2013, a total of 33 LIGHTPATH<sup>®</sup> units and 101 LIGHTPATH<sup>®</sup> fibres have been installed on approximately 56% of the Dive Support Vessels \(DSVs\) operating in the North Sea \(15% of the world’s fleet\), including the entire fleet of two major operators.
