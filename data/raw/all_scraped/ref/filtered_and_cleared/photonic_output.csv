This paper represented a primary outcome from the >10MEu EU/FP7 MODEGAP programme and generated major interest in the telecommunication research community (e.g. https://www.osaopn.org/home/articles/volume-30/march-2019/features/time-to-open-the-2-micron-window/). Consequently several major research programs around the world are exploring this topic, including: EPSRC UK EP/P030181/1 “Airguide Photonics”, NSF Singapore, “A cutting-edge silicon based Mid-IR photonics platform for emerging communication and sensing applications,” and SFI Ireland “IPIC2  Irish Photonic Integration Research Centre."""

The method, thoroughly validated through numerous examples, effectively closes the feedback loop in the design of hollow core fibers.  It laid the groundwork for new thinking in fibre design, eventually leading to two granted and now licensed patents (US2016209586A1, US2016236964A1). It has since been adopted by various other research groups (for example https://doi.org/10.1117/12.2270183 and https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.9.044001) to provide fibre design feedback for various applications."

The work was highlighted in an AIM photonics ($200M USA Government funded industry consortium) road mapping exercise and has led to 9 invited conference talks. A strong case was made for other thickness platforms leading to EPSRC funding of Cornerstone and Cornerstone 2, fabrication capabilities at Southampton serving the entire UK silicon photonics community (EP/L021129/1 (£2.2M), EP/T019697/1 (£1.5M)). Cornerstone, used by 25 research groups and 5 paying industry partners, has won prizes at the Photonic Integrated Circuit International conference and OCP Future Technologies Symposium."
