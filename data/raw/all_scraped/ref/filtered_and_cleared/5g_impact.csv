University of Southampton,AccelerComm: hardware acceleration spin-out for 5G communications,Technological,[UK];[China];[USA];[Global],,[ICURE Aid for Start Ups Cohort 4],[EPSRC];[Innovate UK],"
###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Professor Rob Maunder and his team at the University of Southampton have developed methodologies for the joint design of signal processing algorithms and their hardware acceleration for mobile communication. Since March 2016, the impact of this research has been as follows: 

 **I1** Creation of a spin\-out company AccelerComm Ltd to develop the research into commercial\-grade hardware accelerator designs. AccelerComm now employs 33 people, has a valuation of over \[text removed for publication\] and offers 27 hardware accelerator design products protected by 5 granted patents and a further 32 patent applications. 

 **I2** Deployment of hardware accelerator designs in 5G base\-stations, test\-and\-measurement equipment, satellites and user devices world\-wide, through 58 licenses of the AccelerComm products to \[text removed for publication\] organisations including National Instruments, \[text removed for publication\], generating \[text removed for publication\] of license sales booking for AccelerComm, plus royalty commitments that will be realised in future years. 

 **I3** Contributing to the global standards that define 5G. Maunder led a consortium including Ericsson, LG Electronics, Orange, NEC and Sony that contributed to defining the hardware accelerated signal processing aspects of the global standard for 5G mobile communication. 

 **I4** Facilitating 5G deployment. Research has led to open source simulation models that, in combination with AccelerComm's partnerships with hardware vendors Intel, Xilinx and Achronix, have contributed to the development of a global eco\-system for open standardised hardware platforms for 5G base\-station implementation, enabling the 'integration in a day' of hardware accelerators. 

 **I5** Maunder informed part of the UK government's Future Telecoms Infrastructure Review, which sets the flagship policy for the roll\-out of 5G in the UK, with the target of providing 5G coverage to the majority of the UK population by 2027.

University of Edinburgh,Code size reduction enables cost savings and enhances functionality of modem and WiFi chipsets,Technological,,,,[EPSRC],"
#  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research led by the University of Edinburgh \(UoE\) has resulted in a compiler tool that reduces firmware code size by up to 12% in modem chips for smartphones and Internet of Things \(IoT\) devices. The research has been commercialised by world\-leading smartphone chip manufacturer Qualcomm, and employed in more than 175,000,000 5G handsets worldwide. It enabled the company to bring to market modem chips that are smaller, more energy efficient, and/or able to perform more complex functions \(such as compatibility with 5G\) than previously possible. As an early adopter of the open\-sourced UoE research, Qualcomm’s business has significantly improved, borne out both in their clients’ ability to manufacture devices with novel functionality, and in their elimination of competitors from the 5G modem chip market.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Pioneering studies at the University of Southampton’s Optoelectronics Research Centre \(ORC\) have demonstrated a set of hollow core optical fibre structures with world\-record properties, proving the commercial viability of a technology designed to disrupt how data communications systems operate and meet increasing global demand for higher bandwidth. Through the spin\-out of fast\-growing company Lumenisity Ltd in January 2016, the commercialisation of hollow core fibre \(HCF\) technology has delivered significant economic impact, including: \[text removed for publication\] raised in external investment, with \~50% coming from overseas into the UK economy; the creation of more than 50 highly skilled engineering and manufacturing jobs at a new \[text removed for publication\] facility in the Southampton area; and revenues approaching \[text removed for publication\] from the sale of first\-generation products with very strong growth forecast in the coming years. The first commercial deployment of HCFs has delivered technical, and therefore financial, benefits to companies in the financial services sector with proof\-of\-concept trials planned in other data communication and telecommunication applications: notably in data centre interconnect and 5G backhaul – both critical if the UK is to meet its broadband connectivity goals. Lumenisity and the ORC are now receiving enquiries and are engaged with many world\-leading companies both in the UK and internationally.

###  1. Summary of the impact 

 Research at UCL pioneered the suite of Multipath Transmission Control Protocols \(MPTCP\). These protocols improve the efficiency of data transfer across the Internet when compared to the classic suite of transfer protocols “TCP/IP”. The UCL team demonstrated the improved effectiveness of these protocols which has led to multiple commercial deployments, either by Internet Service Providers or by companies such as phone handset suppliers. In addition, UCL research has been incorporated into Operating Systems such as Apple’s iOS and Linux and it is now shaping the design of 5G cellular networks. As a result of UCL research, millions of users benefit every day from smoother transitions between different Internet connections ensuring that online services have a much higher performance and reliability.
